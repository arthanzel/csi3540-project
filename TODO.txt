- Euler (done)
- Midpoint and trapezoid
- Simpson with 2 or 3 different precisions
- RK
- A stochastic approach like Gillespie where the next point is where the derivative changes over a certain threshold.
    - Binary search lookahead to find the threshold abscissa
- Detect domain error, like log(-1) which returns NaN

- Clean up CSS and Open Sans import
- Callback page error handler
- Enable source maps again


Multiple helper functions in modules might have been a mistake. Webpack bundles the entire module's dependency tree in the final bundle, which makes small files very large.

- Euler (done)
- Midpoint and trapezoid
- Simpson with 2 or 3 different precisions
- RK
- A stochastic approach like Gillespie where the next point is where the derivative changes over a certain threshold.
    - Binary search lookahead to find the threshold abscissa
- Detect domain error, like log(-1) which returns NaN
- Impose limits on number of projects, equations, and parameters
